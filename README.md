# BlackLitterman

The BlackLitterman model uses a Bayesian approach for asset allocation. It combines an **prior**(initial) estimate of returns (like the CAPM) with investor **views** on assets to produce a **posterior**(updated) estimate of expected returns.
This is an implementation of the model for the Moroccan financial market, with a GUI for inputting **views**.
